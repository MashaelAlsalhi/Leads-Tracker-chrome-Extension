# Leads-Tracker-chrome-Extension

I built this simple Leads Tracker Extension for Chrome using JavaScript in the scope of the course at Scrimba.
This extension gives the user an opportunity to create a list of URLs by entering one or by saving URL of an active tab.
The application also allows the user to delete all the saved items.


## How to deploy  it 
- Download the folder 
- Open  chrome://extensions/ 
- Then click <strong>load unpacked</strong> button at the top.
* Congrats you have the extensions now on you google chrome !
